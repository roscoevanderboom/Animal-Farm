# Animal-Farm
Another project to practice Javascript. I managed to get the main functionality of the game working. Now I offer it to the community and anyone is welcome to clone, fork or improve the project in any way they wish. 


<h3>Notice! Main Bug:</h3>

<p>The three-in-a-row function works ( based on reading 8 preset array arrangements ), though there are occasions when a player will be awarded a win, even though the array inputs are not uniform. I've been trying to figure out why this happens. 
</p>

<h3>About the Game</h3>

<p>This is an adaptation of the famous TIC-TAC-TOE game. Currently the game can be played by 2 players sitting at the same computer. One of the main goals is to build a database/backend for the app to allow players from around the world to play against each other. Further extensions could include user profiles, rankings, and other multiplayer functions. 
</p>
<p>The board consists of a large grid with 9 squares ( traditional TicTacToe ) with nested grids of the same design.
    The player name will be highlighted on their turn to play. There is a timer to that runs down and resets with 
    every turn.
</p>

<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>First select your avatar. Then, player 1 starts the game. Every time you click, you not only place your token, you also designate where your opponent will play. The game ends when the timer runs, you have not been able to move or someone has scored 3-in-a-row.
