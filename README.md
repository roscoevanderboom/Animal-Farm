<h3>About the Game</h3>

<p>This game is intended for 2 people sitting at the same computer. Once I get to the backend 
    part of my studies, I hope to put it online so you could play against people on other computers.
</p>
<p>The board consists of a large grid of 9 squares ( traditional TicTacToe ) with nested grids of the same design.
    The player name will be highlighted on their turn to play. There is a timer to that runs down and resets with 
    every turn.
</p>

<h3>How to play</h3>
<p>Player 1 starts the game. Every time you click, you not only place your token ( O or X ), you also designate 
    where the next player will play. The game ends when the timer runs and you have not been able to move.
